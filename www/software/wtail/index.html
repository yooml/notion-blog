<h1 id="what_is_it">What is it?</h1>
<p>
  wTail does what Unix command <tt>tail</tt> does except it does it on
  Windows and has a GUI interface. </p>
<p>
  To those not familiar with <tt>tail</tt>. Imagine you develop a PHP
  app. If the app throws warnings or errors, it'll write them to
  Apache error log. That's why you want to watch addition to error log
  file. This app helps exactly in that: you select a file and then you
  can see all changes made to a file in a window.</p>
<p>
  You can also change the font and and clear the window content with
  a press of a button.</p>
<p>
  Of course you can watch any kinds of files, not only Apache logs.</p>

Here's how it looks (watching Apache's access log file):
<p>
<img src="wtail-00.gif" />
</p>
The shortest manual in the world:
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="menu-file.gif" /></td>
<td><img src="menu-tools.gif" /></td>
<td><img src="menu-help.gif" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><strong>File/Open</strong> is for selecting file to watch.<br/>
<strong>File/Close</strong> is for stoping watching the file.<br/>
<strong>File/Exit</strong> is for exiting the app.<br/>
<strong>Tools/Clear</strong> clears the output window.<br/>
<strong>Tools/Wrap</strong> is for changing of wrapping of the output window.<br/>
<strong>File/Font...</strong> is for changing the font used to display the file. Unfortunately this setting is not persisted.<br/>
<strong>Help/About</strong> brings embarassingly ugly About dialog box.<br/>
<strong>Help/Visit website</strong> will bring you to this page.<br/>

0.1 (2004-06-12):
<ul>
  <li>first version</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="todo">Todo </h3>
<p>There's potential for improvements:
<ul>
  <li>ability to watch multiple files, use tab-based interface</li>
  <li>remember all opened files, add the "open recent..."</li>
  <li>add, as an option, ability to auto-scroll the view</li>
</ul>

As noted, this program is simple, does one thing that is useful to me. It might
never get any better and there's not much to talk about. If you, however, have
a burning desire to talk to me about it (you know, comments, bug reports, suggestions
etc.), you can always <a href="/">send
me an e-mail</a>.
