<h1>Optimizing v8</h1>

<p>This case study shows that even mature code can have opportunities for optimization. When I noticed an opportunity to optimize disassembler in v8, it was already at version 1.3.6 and had more than 2700 checkins.</p>

<h2>Sources of waste</h2>

<p>Disassembler is driven by 2 data structures: InstructionDesc and InstructionTable.</p>

<p><a href='src/disasm-ia32.cc.html'>disasm-ia32.cc</a> (<a href='src/disasm-ia32.cc.txt'>raw</a>):
<pre><code class="cpp">
struct InstructionDesc {
  const char* mnem;
  InstructionType type;
  OperandOrder op_order_;
};
</code></pre>
</p>

<p><a href='src/disasm-ia32.cc.html'>disasm-ia32.cc</a> (<a href='src/disasm-ia32.cc.txt'>raw</a>):
<pre><code class="cpp">
struct ByteMnemonic {
  int b;  // -1 terminates, otherwise must be in range (0..255)
  const char* mnem;
  OperandOrder op_order_;
};
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>At runtime, InstructionDesc structure describes instruction for a given byte. InstructionTable class contains a 256 element array of InstructionDesc structures. On 32-bit architecture sizeof(InstructionDesc) is 12 bytes so the whole array consumes 12*256 = 3072 bytes.</p>

<p>This table is built at runtime from several arrays of ByteMnemonic struct. There are 41 elements in total and since sizeof(ByteMnemonic) is 12, they use 492 bytes of static space.</p>

<p>Total space used: 3564 bytes.</p>

<h2>Eliminating the waste</h2>

<h3>Removing unnecesary code and data</h3>

<p>First observation is that InstructionDesc array could just as well be embedded as static data. We could get rid of 492 bytes of ByteMnemonic data and the code that builds InstructionDesc array out of ByteMnemonic data.</p>

<p>Presumably it was done that way for readability. We certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to create the array data manually &#8211; it would be tedious and the data would be inscrutable. We can fix that with a python script that generates C code statically defining InstructionDesc array using the same ByteMnemonic data currently part of C code. The resulting data will still be inscrutable but the process of generating it will be as readable as before.</p>

<h3>Singleton class is just a bunch of scoped functions and data</h3>

<p>Another observation is that InstructionTable class is unnecessary. There&#8217;s only one instance of it and when we switched to having InstructionDesc data defined at compilation time, it gets reduced to only one function. We can replace InstructionTable class with the one remaining function.</p>

<h3>Using the most efficient encoding</h3>

<p>Another observation is that encoding of data is inefficient. InstructionType enum has 8 possible values and could be encoded in 3 bits, but an enum requires 4 bytes. OperandOrder enum has 3 possible values and coudl be encoded in 2 bits, but uses 4 bytes. Using bitfield we could replace 8 bytes with just one:</p>

<code class="cpp"><pre>
struct InstructionDesc {
  const char* mnem;
  unsigned char type : 3;
  unsigned char op_order_ : 2;
};
</pre></code>

<h3>Split arrays to avoid alignment padding</h3>

<p>Unfortunately even though mnem only uses 4 bytes and type + op_order_ use 1 byte, sizeof(InstructionDesc) is 8 bytes, not 5. On 64-bit processor it would be even worse and the size would be 16. Elements in a C struct are aligned to their natural size so e.g. pointers are aligned to 4 or 8 bytes (on 32-bit and 64-bit respectively). The size of the whole struct also needs to be rounded to the alignement of the first element to allow making arrays of structures.</p>

<p>If the padding is significant part of the structure (as in this case where we waste 3 out of 8 bytes), we can split one structure in two and split data into 2 arrays.</p>

<code class="cpp"><pre>
struct InstructionDescOpType {
  unsigned char op_order_ : 2;
  unsigned char type : 3;
};
</pre></code>

<p>The other struct would contain only one member (char * pointer) which we can simplify to using char * pointer directly.</p>

<p>At this point we reduced the size of data from 3564 bytes to 1280 (256 * (1 + 4)).</p>

<h3>Pointer compression</h3>

<p>A pointer needs 4 or 8 bytes. We can compress pointers by only storing an offset relative to a known address. This is a perfect technique for our case because a total lenght of all possible mnemonic strings is less than 256 so we only need 1 byte if we lay out mnemonics sequentially in memory. As a bonus we no longer need to split the array to avoid alignment padding and we end up with:</p>

<code class="cpp"><pre>
struct InstructionDesc {
  unsigned char mnem_off;
  unsigned char op_order_ : 2;
  unsigned char type : 3;
};
</pre></code>

<p>which only consumes 512 bytes. We reduced per-element usage from 12 bytes to 2 bytes.</p><hr>
